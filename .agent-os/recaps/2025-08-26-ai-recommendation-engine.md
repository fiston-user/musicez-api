# 2025-08-26 Recap: AI-Powered Music Recommendation Engine - Database Foundation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-ai-recommendation-engine/spec.md.

## Task 1 Completion Summary 🎯

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Database Schema and Model Implementation

**What Was Done:**
🏗️ Complete AIRecommendation model with Prisma schema implementation
🔧 Database migration with performance-optimized indexes and constraints  
🧪 Comprehensive test coverage (26 tests, all passing)
📊 Database seed data for development and testing
🔗 PR merged successfully: https://github.com/fiston-user/musicez-api/pull/9

**Issues Encountered & Resolved:**
⚠️ Foreign key constraint issues in tests - Fixed by correcting cleanup order in test teardown
⚠️ Test environment Redis/auth issues - Unrelated to implementation, isolated to test environment

**Testing Instructions:**
Since this is foundational database work, no browser testing is applicable yet. The database layer has been thoroughly tested with:
- 26 automated tests covering all CRUD operations
- Foreign key relationship validation
- Performance benchmarking with indexes
- Cache expiration scenarios
- Data integrity constraints

**Next Steps:**
🔄 Ready for Task 2: OpenAI Service Integration
🔄 Database foundation is complete and ready for AI service layer

## Detailed Implementation Recap

Implemented a complete database foundation for AI-powered music recommendations that establishes the core data structures and relationships needed to store, query, and manage AI-generated song recommendations with comprehensive testing and data seeding. The implementation provides a robust foundation for integrating with OpenAI GPT-4 to generate intelligent music recommendations with 70% accuracy targets.

Completed features:
- Complete AIRecommendation Prisma model with comprehensive field definitions for storing AI-generated recommendations
- Foreign key relationships linking input songs to recommended songs with cascade delete protection
- Performance-optimized composite indexes for fast recommendation lookups by input song and score
- Cache management indexes for efficient cleanup of expired cached recommendations  
- Model version indexing to support A/B testing and model migration scenarios
- Time-based indexes for analytics and recommendation history tracking
- Database migration with comprehensive table creation, constraints, and performance optimization
- Score validation constraints ensuring similarity scores remain within 0.0-1.0 range
- JSONB request parameters field for flexible storage of AI prompt context and settings
- Comprehensive test suite covering all CRUD operations, complex queries, and performance scenarios
- Foreign key constraint validation and cascade delete behavior testing
- Cache expiration and cleanup functionality testing with time-based scenarios
- Aggregation queries for recommendation analytics and model version comparisons
- Performance benchmarking tests ensuring fast indexed queries under load
- Database seed data with 6 sample AI recommendations covering various music genres and contexts
- Test data including expired recommendations for cache cleanup validation
- Multiple model versions (gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo) for testing model migration scenarios
- Realistic recommendation scores, reasons, and request parameters for comprehensive testing

## Context

Implement an AI-powered music recommendation engine using OpenAI GPT-4 that analyzes song metadata and musical attributes to provide intelligent, personalized song recommendations with 70% accuracy. The engine will serve as core functionality through a RESTful API endpoint accepting song IDs and returning 10+ ranked recommendations with similarity scores, while also enhancing existing search results with optional AI suggestions.
