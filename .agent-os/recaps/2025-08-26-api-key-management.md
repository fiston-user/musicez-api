# 2025-08-26 Recap: API Key Management Endpoints

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-api-key-management/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented a comprehensive and secure API key management system that provides administrators with full CRUD operations for managing external service credentials through REST endpoints. The system establishes secure storage, validation, tracking, and monitoring capabilities for service API keys used to authenticate with external services like Spotify Web API and OpenAI, forming the foundation for third-party integrations.

Completed features:
- Comprehensive Zod validation schemas with input sanitization for API key names and values
- Request/response middleware with standardized error handling and validation
- AES-256-GCM encryption for secure key storage alongside bcrypt hashing utilities
- API key masking functionality for secure display in responses and logging
- Standardized response formatters with consistent JSON API structure
- Full CRUD operations controller (ApiKeyController) with secure storage and retrieval
- Automatic lastUsed timestamp tracking for usage monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging for all API key operations and security events
- JWT-authenticated REST endpoints at /api/v1/admin/api-keys with admin-level protection
- Rate limiting configuration to prevent abuse of administrative endpoints
- Request ID tracking for debugging and monitoring purposes
- CORS configuration optimized for admin interface access
- Extensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and security validation tests
- Input validation and error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Admin-level authorization middleware to restrict access to authorized administrators
