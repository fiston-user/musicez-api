# 2025-08-26 Recap: JWT Authentication System

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-jwt-auth-system/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the core security infrastructure for MusicEZ's JWT-based authentication system, establishing secure password management, token generation/validation, and Redis-based session management. The system provides the foundation for user registration/login and dual authentication (JWT + API key) support, with proper token lifecycle management and immediate session revocation capabilities.

Completed features:
- Secure password hashing and validation system with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Password complexity requirements and secure comparison utilities
- JWT access token generation with 15-minute expiry and user claims
- JWT token validation middleware with signature verification
- Refresh token generation using UUID-based tokens with 7-day expiry
- Redis-based session management for refresh token storage and retrieval
- Token revocation functionality for single and multi-device logout
- Automatic cleanup service for expired tokens
- Device tracking and metadata storage for security monitoring
- Comprehensive test coverage for all security components

## Context

Implement a secure JWT-based authentication system that supports both user registration/login and API key authentication for MusicEZ's music recommendation API. The system provides JWT access tokens (15min) and refresh tokens (7 days) with Redis-based session management for immediate revocation, while maintaining the privacy-first, stateless architecture and supporting both B2B integrations and consumer applications through dual authentication middleware.
