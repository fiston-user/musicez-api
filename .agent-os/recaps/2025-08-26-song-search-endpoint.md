# 2025-08-26 Recap: Song Search Endpoint with Fuzzy Matching

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-song-search-endpoint/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the foundational database infrastructure and search service for MusicEZ's fuzzy song search endpoint, enabling typo-tolerant music discovery through PostgreSQL's trigram similarity. The system provides comprehensive fuzzy matching capabilities for song titles and artist names, establishing the core search functionality that will power the `/api/v1/songs/search` endpoint.

Completed features:
- PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension enabled for trigram similarity search
- Song model enhanced with searchVector field for optimized fuzzy matching
- Database migrations with GIN indexes for high-performance trigram operations
- Automatic search vector population via database triggers on insert/update
- Comprehensive SongSearchService with query sanitization and normalization
- Fuzzy search algorithm supporting similarity scoring and result ranking
- Advanced query validation with configurable similarity thresholds (0.1-1.0)
- Result limiting and pagination support (default 20, max 50 results)
- Performance-optimized database queries using Prisma raw SQL
- Search suggestions functionality for autocomplete features
- Search metadata and analytics capabilities for performance monitoring
- Extensive test coverage for database operations and search functionality
- Sample song database seeded with 10 diverse tracks for testing
- Sub-200ms query performance validation through comprehensive testing

## Context

Implement a fuzzy search endpoint that allows users to search for songs by title and artist name with typo tolerance and partial matching. This feature will enable users to find songs even with imperfect queries, improving the user experience and setting the foundation for the recommendation engine. The MVP searches the local database, returns ranked results with similarity scores, and maintains sub-200ms response times for improved user experience.
