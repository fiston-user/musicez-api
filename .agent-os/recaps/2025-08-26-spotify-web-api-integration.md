This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-spotify-web-api-integration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Spotify Web API integration that provides secure user authentication, real-time data access, and automated background synchronization. The implementation includes OAuth 2.0 authentication flow, RESTful endpoints for user playlists and recently played tracks, background sync service with cron scheduling, admin management interface, and enhanced search integration with Spotify metadata.

Key components delivered:
- Complete Spotify OAuth authentication system with secure token management
- User data endpoints (playlists, recent tracks) with proper rate limiting and scope validation  
- Background sync service using node-cron for automated data updates
- Admin interface for sync job monitoring and management
- Enhanced search service with Spotify metadata integration
- Comprehensive security measures including token encryption and request validation
- Full test coverage for all implemented functionality

## Context

Implement a hybrid Spotify Web API integration that supplements the existing local song database with fresh Spotify metadata while providing expanded search capabilities. This integration maintains local search performance while offering access to Spotify's comprehensive music catalog, real-time popularity data, and optional user account integration for personalized features. The system will enhance the existing search API with Spotify audio features, preview URLs, and up-to-date metadata through background synchronization and on-demand enrichment.
