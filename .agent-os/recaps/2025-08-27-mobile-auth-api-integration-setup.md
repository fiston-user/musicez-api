- **Spotify Integration**: OAuth flow, metadata sync, and user playlist endpoints
- **API Management**: Admin endpoints for key lifecycle management with comprehensive testing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching, comprehensive test coverage

### Mobile App: Foundation Complete ✅
- **React Native Setup**: Expo project with TypeScript configuration
- **Navigation System**: React Navigation v6 with auth/main flow switching
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Project Structure**: Organized architecture ready for feature development
- **Development Environment**: Configured and tested mobile development setup

## Documentation Created

### Updated Mission Statement
- **File**: `/Volumes/T7/Developer/projects/apps/musicez/.agent-os/product/mission.md`
- **Updates**: Reflected mature platform state with both backend API and mobile app, updated user personas and differentiators
- **Focus**: Positioned as production-ready API with mobile-first discovery experience

### Updated Product Roadmap  
- **File**: `/Volumes/T7/Developer/projects/apps/musicez/.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- **Status**: Marked Phase 0 and Phase 1 as completed, updated Phase 4 with current mobile development progress
- **Current Priority**: Authentication API Integration highlighted as immediate next task

### New Specification Created
- **File**: `/Volumes/T7/Developer/projects/apps/musicez/.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-mobile-auth-api-integration/spec.md`
- **Scope**: Comprehensive specification for connecting mobile Zustand store to backend JWT authentication endpoints
- **Details**: Technical requirements, API specifications, security implementation, and acceptance criteria

### Tasks Document Created
- **File**: `/Volumes/T7/Developer/projects/apps/musicez/.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-mobile-auth-api-integration/tasks.md`
- **Structure**: 13 task groups across 5 phases covering API service layer, state management, UI implementation, error handling, and testing
- **Timeline**: 2-week development plan with clear dependencies and success criteria

## Next Priority: Authentication API Integration

### Immediate Task
Implement authentication API service layer to connect mobile app Zustand store with backend JWT authentication system.

### Key Technical Requirements
- **AuthService**: HTTP client with axios for backend API communication
- **Token Management**: Secure storage with Expo SecureStore (refresh) and memory (access)
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatic token refresh 5 minutes before expiration
- **Form Implementation**: Login/Register screens with validation and error handling
- **State Integration**: Connect Zustand auth store with API service methods

### Success Metrics
- Users can register and login through mobile app
- Authentication state persists between app sessions  
- Token refresh works automatically without user intervention
- Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- Integration tests achieve >90% code coverage

## Technical Context

### API Base Configuration
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
- **Auth Endpoints**: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/logout-all`
- **Token Format**: Bearer JWT with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
- **Security**: Rate limiting, password validation, Redis session storage

### Mobile Stack
- **Framework**: Expo React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with auth flow switching
- **State**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors for token management
- **Secure Storage**: Expo SecureStore for refresh token storage

## Current Status

The MusicEZ platform is well-positioned as a mature, production-ready music recommendation system with:
- Complete backend API with comprehensive authentication, AI recommendations, and Spotify integration
- Mobile app foundation with proper architecture and state management
- Clear roadmap for authentication API integration as the immediate next development priority

Agent OS documentation now accurately reflects the sophisticated state of the platform and provides detailed guidance for the next development phase.
