> Spec: AI Recommendation Engine using OpenAI GPT-4  
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement an AI-powered music recommendation engine using OpenAI GPT-4 that analyzes song metadata and musical attributes to provide intelligent, personalized song recommendations. This engine will serve as the core functionality to transform MusicEZ from a search-only service into a comprehensive music discovery platform with 70% recommendation accuracy.

## User Stories

### Music Discovery for Developers

As a developer integrating MusicEZ API, I want to send a song ID and receive 10+ intelligent recommendations, so that I can build engaging music discovery features in my application.

When a developer sends a POST request with a song ID, the system analyzes the song's musical DNA (genre, tempo, key, energy, mood) using GPT-4's natural language understanding, cross-references similar songs in the database, and returns a ranked list of recommendations with similarity scores and reasoning.

### Enhanced Search Results

As an API user, I want search results to include AI-powered recommendations alongside fuzzy matches, so that I can discover new music even when my search query is imprecise.

The system enhances existing search functionality by providing an optional "recommend" parameter that triggers AI analysis of top search results and returns both exact matches and AI-suggested similar songs.

### Contextual Music Recommendations

As a music application developer, I want to provide contextual recommendations based on musical attributes and user context, so that my users discover music that matches their current mood or activity.

The AI engine considers multiple factors including song energy levels, danceability, valence (positivity), and acoustic features to generate contextually appropriate recommendations that go beyond simple genre matching.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Recommendation API** - RESTful endpoint accepting song ID input and returning 10+ AI-generated recommendations with similarity scores
2. **GPT-4 Integration** - Natural language processing of song metadata and musical attributes to generate intelligent recommendations  
3. **Recommendation Caching** - Redis-based caching system to store AI recommendations and improve response times
4. **Batch Processing Support** - Endpoint capability to handle multiple song inputs for bulk recommendation generation
5. **Search Enhancement** - Optional AI recommendation integration with existing fuzzy search functionality

## Out of Scope

- Real-time audio analysis or audio file processing
- User preference learning or personalization beyond current session
- Playlist generation or music queue management
- Integration with external music streaming services beyond Spotify metadata
- Machine learning model training or custom recommendation algorithms

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional API Endpoint** - POST /api/v1/recommendations endpoint that accepts song ID and returns 10+ recommendations with <3 second response time
2. **Search Integration** - Enhanced search results with optional AI recommendations that maintain existing <200ms response time for search-only queries
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit and integration tests achieving 80%+ coverage for recommendation engine components with accuracy validation against known musical similarity patterns
