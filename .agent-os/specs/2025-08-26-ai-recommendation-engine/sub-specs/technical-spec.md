# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-ai-recommendation-engine/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core API Implementation
- **POST /api/v1/recommendations** endpoint with Zod validation for song ID input and recommendation parameters
- **GET /api/v1/songs/search** enhancement with optional `recommend=true` query parameter for AI-powered search results
- Response format following existing API patterns with `success`, `data`, `timestamp` structure
- JWT authentication required using existing `authenticateToken` middleware
- Rate limiting: 10 requests per minute for recommendation endpoint (higher cost due to AI processing)

### OpenAI GPT-4 Integration  
- GPT-4 API integration using `openai` npm package for recommendation generation
- Structured prompting system that analyzes song metadata (title, artist, genre, tempo, key, energy, danceability, valence)
- Response parsing to extract recommended song titles/artists and similarity reasoning
- Error handling for API rate limits, timeouts, and invalid responses
- Token usage optimization through efficient prompt design

### Database Integration
- Leverage existing PostgreSQL song database with trigram search for recommended song matching
- Create `Recommendation` table to store AI-generated recommendations with caching metadata
- Implement recommendation scoring system (0.0-1.0 similarity scale) compatible with existing search similarity
- Track recommendation performance metrics (accuracy, user feedback) for future optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for AI recommendations with 1-hour TTL (longer than search due to higher computation cost)
- Cache key format: `ai_rec:{songId}:{limit}:{hash}` where hash includes relevant parameters
- Cache hit rate monitoring and automatic cache warming for popular songs
- Background cache refresh system to maintain recommendation freshness

### Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous OpenAI API calls with 5-second timeout
- Concurrent database queries for recommended song lookups
- Response streaming for large recommendation sets
- Fallback to collaborative filtering when AI service unavailable

## External Dependencies

- **openai** (^4.0.0) - Official OpenAI API client for GPT-4 integration
- **Justification:** Required for AI-powered recommendation generation, provides type safety and error handling for OpenAI API calls
