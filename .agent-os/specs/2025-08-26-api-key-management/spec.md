# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: API Key Management Endpoints
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement secure CRUD endpoints for managing service API keys used to authenticate with external services like Spotify Web API and OpenAI. This feature enables administrators to securely store, manage, and monitor external service credentials, establishing the foundation for third-party integrations.

## User Stories

### Administrator API Key Management

As an administrator, I want to manage service API keys through REST endpoints, so that I can securely configure external service credentials without direct database access.

The administrator can create new API keys with descriptive names, update existing keys when credentials change, view all configured keys with their status and last-used timestamps, and disable or delete keys when services are no longer needed. This provides a secure interface for credential management.

### System Integration Management

As a system administrator, I want to track API key usage and status, so that I can monitor external service integrations and troubleshoot authentication issues.

The system automatically updates last-used timestamps when keys are accessed, tracks active/inactive status, and provides visibility into which external services are configured and operational.

## Spec Scope

1. **API Key CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete endpoints for managing service API keys
2. **Authentication Protection** - All endpoints require JWT authentication to prevent unauthorized access
3. **Key Status Management** - Enable/disable functionality to control key availability without deletion
4. **Usage Tracking** - Automatic tracking of last-used timestamps for monitoring purposes
5. **Validation and Error Handling** - Comprehensive request validation and standardized error responses

## Out of Scope

- User-facing API keys for external developers accessing MusicEZ
- API key rotation automation 
- Expiration date functionality
- Permission levels or role-based access control
- Usage analytics beyond last-used timestamps

## Expected Deliverable

1. REST endpoints at /api/v1/admin/api-keys supporting full CRUD operations with JWT authentication
2. Secure storage of service API keys using existing database schema with proper validation
3. Administrative interface for managing Spotify and OpenAI API keys through standardized JSON responses
