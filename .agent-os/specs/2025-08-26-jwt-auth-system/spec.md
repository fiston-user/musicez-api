# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: JWT Authentication System  
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement a secure JWT-based authentication system that supports both user registration/login and API key authentication for MusicEZ's music recommendation API. This system will provide the security foundation for user-specific features while maintaining the privacy-first, stateless architecture and supporting both B2B integrations and consumer applications.

## User Stories

### User Registration and Login

As a music enthusiast developer, I want to register for an account and authenticate with JWT tokens, so that I can access personalized music recommendation features and manage my API usage.

**Workflow:** Users can register with email/password, receive JWT access tokens (15min expiry) and refresh tokens (7 days), and use these tokens to access protected endpoints. The system supports token refresh without re-authentication and secure logout with token revocation.

### API Developer Integration

As an app developer, I want flexible authentication options (JWT tokens or API keys), so that I can integrate MusicEZ recommendations into my application using the most appropriate authentication method for my use case.

**Workflow:** Developers can choose between JWT authentication for user-facing features or API key authentication for service-to-service integration. Both authentication methods provide access to the same recommendation endpoints with appropriate rate limiting.

### Secure Session Management

As a user, I want secure session management with immediate logout capability, so that my account remains protected even if I lose access to my device or suspect unauthorized access.

**Workflow:** Users can log out from individual devices or all devices simultaneously. Refresh tokens are stored in Redis for immediate revocation, and the system provides clear feedback about authentication status and token expiration.

## Spec Scope

1. **User Registration System** - Email/password registration with secure password hashing and validation
2. **JWT Token Management** - Access token (15min) and refresh token (7 days) generation, validation, and rotation
3. **Dual Authentication Middleware** - Flexible middleware supporting both JWT tokens and API keys for endpoint protection
4. **Redis-Based Session Storage** - Refresh token storage in Redis for immediate revocation and session management
5. **Password Security** - bcrypt hashing, password complexity validation, and secure password reset flow

## Out of Scope

- Email verification during registration (will be added in future phase)
- Social media authentication (OAuth providers)
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA)
- User profile management beyond basic auth
- API key generation by users (API keys remain admin-managed for now)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Authentication Endpoints** - POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, POST /auth/refresh, POST /auth/logout working in browser/Postman with proper JWT token handling
2. **Protected Route Access** - Existing health endpoints and future music recommendation endpoints properly protected with dual authentication (JWT OR API key)
3. **Token Management** - JWT tokens with proper expiration, refresh token rotation, and Redis-based session revocation working end-to-end
