> Spec: Project Setup with Express.js, TypeScript, and Prisma
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Initialize a production-ready Express.js API server with TypeScript support and Prisma ORM connected to PostgreSQL. This foundation will enable rapid development of the MusicEZ recommendation API with type safety, database management, and comprehensive development tooling.

## User Stories

### Developer Setup Story

As a developer, I want to clone the repository and have a working development environment with one command, so that I can start building features immediately.

The developer clones the repository, runs `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`, and has a fully functional API server running locally with hot reload, database connection, and all development tools configured. Docker Compose provides PostgreSQL and Redis instances, environment variables are properly validated, and the TypeScript compiler ensures type safety throughout the codebase.

### API Development Story

As an API developer, I want a well-structured Express.js application with TypeScript and Prisma, so that I can build type-safe endpoints with database operations.

The project structure follows best practices with clear separation of concerns - controllers, services, models, and middleware are organized in distinct directories. Prisma provides type-safe database access with migrations support, while TypeScript ensures compile-time checking across the entire API surface.

### DevOps Setup Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker configuration and CI/CD pipelines ready, so that I can deploy and monitor the application reliably.

The application includes Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations for both development and production environments. GitHub Actions workflows run tests, linting, and type checking on every push, with automated deployment capabilities to staging and production environments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Express.js Server Setup** - Configure Express with TypeScript, middleware stack (CORS, helmet, compression), and structured routing
2. **TypeScript Configuration** - Strict mode TypeScript with proper path aliases, build configuration, and development hot-reload using tsx
3. **Prisma ORM Integration** - Initialize Prisma with PostgreSQL connection, migration system, and type-safe client generation
4. **Docker Development Environment** - Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL, Redis, and application with proper networking and volumes
5. **Testing Infrastructure** - Jest configuration with TypeScript support, Supertest for API testing, and initial test structure

## Out of Scope

- Actual API endpoints implementation (beyond health check)
- Authentication/authorization logic (JWT setup only)
- Spotify or OpenAI API integrations
- Production deployment configuration
- Frontend application setup
- Actual database schema for music/recommendations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Running `npm run dev` starts a local Express server on port 3000 with hot-reload, connected to PostgreSQL and Redis via Docker
2. Accessing `http://localhost:3000/health` returns a JSON response confirming server status and database connectivity
3. Running `npm test` executes Jest tests with TypeScript support, including a passing health check test
