# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a fuzzy search endpoint at `/api/v1/songs/search` that enables searching for songs by title and artist with typo tolerance using PostgreSQL's full-text search and trigram similarity. The MVP will search the local database, return ranked results with similarity scores, and maintain sub-200ms response times for improved user experience.
