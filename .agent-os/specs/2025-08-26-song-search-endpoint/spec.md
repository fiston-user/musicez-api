> Spec: Song Search Endpoint with Fuzzy Matching
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement a fuzzy search endpoint that allows users to search for songs by title and artist name with typo tolerance and partial matching. This feature will enable users to find songs even with imperfect queries, improving the user experience and setting the foundation for the recommendation engine.

## User Stories

### Music Discovery Through Search

As a music enthusiast, I want to search for songs even when I don't remember the exact title or artist name, so that I can find the music I'm looking for without frustration.

The user opens the app and types a partial or misspelled song name like "bohemain rapsody" or "queen bohemian". The system uses fuzzy matching algorithms to understand the intent and returns relevant results including "Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen" despite the typos. The user can then select the correct song to get recommendations or save it to their preferences.

### Developer Integration

As an API developer, I want to integrate song search functionality into my application, so that my users can search for music with a forgiving, user-friendly search experience.

The developer sends a GET request to `/api/v1/songs/search?q=searchterm` with their API key or JWT token. The API returns a JSON array of matching songs with relevance scores, allowing the developer to display search results ranked by accuracy. The fuzzy matching handles common typos and partial matches automatically.

## Spec Scope

1. **Search API Endpoint** - RESTful endpoint accepting search queries with query parameter validation
2. **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm** - PostgreSQL-based full-text search with trigram similarity for typo tolerance
3. **Result Ranking** - Relevance scoring based on similarity percentage and exact matches prioritization
4. **Response Formatting** - Structured JSON responses with song metadata and similarity scores
5. **Search Optimization** - Database indexing and query optimization for sub-200ms response times

## Out of Scope

- Real-time Spotify API integration (planned for next phase)
- Advanced filters (genre, year, tempo)
- Search history or saved searches
- Autocomplete/suggestions while typing
- Playlist or album search

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working `/api/v1/songs/search` endpoint that returns relevant songs for queries with typos or partial matches
2. Search results properly ranked by relevance with at least 80% accuracy for common misspellings
3. API documentation showing example requests and responses with search parameters
