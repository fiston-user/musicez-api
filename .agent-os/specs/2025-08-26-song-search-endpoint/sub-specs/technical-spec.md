# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-song-search-endpoint/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Search Implementation
- Use PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search capabilities with pg_trgm extension for fuzzy matching
- Implement trigram similarity scoring for typo tolerance (minimum 0.3 similarity threshold)
- Combine title and artist fields into a searchable column with proper weighting
- Support case-insensitive searching with Unicode normalization

### Performance Optimization
- Create GIN indexes on searchable columns for faster trigram matching
- Implement query result limiting (default 20, max 50 results)
- Add response caching in Redis for frequently searched queries (5-minute TTL)
- Target sub-200ms response time for 95% of queries

### Request Validation
- Use Zod schema for query parameter validation
- Require minimum 2 characters for search queries
- Sanitize input to prevent SQL injection (though using Prisma parameterized queries)
- Implement rate limiting specific to search endpoint (30 requests per minute)

### Response Structure
- Return array of song objects with similarity scores
- Include fields: id, title, artist, album (if available), duration, releaseYear, similarity
- Sort results by similarity score (highest first)
- Add metadata: total results, query processing time, search query

### Error Handling
- Return 400 for invalid/too short queries
- Return 404 when no results found
- Return 429 for rate limit exceeded
- Log search queries and response times for analytics

## External Dependencies

- **pg_trgm PostgreSQL extension** - Trigram matching for fuzzy search
  - **Justification:** Native PostgreSQL extension providing efficient fuzzy text matching without external services
