> Spec: Spotify Web API Integration
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Implement a hybrid Spotify Web API integration that supplements the existing local song database with fresh Spotify metadata while providing expanded search capabilities. This integration will maintain the performance benefits of local search while offering access to Spotify's comprehensive music catalog and real-time data for enhanced user experience.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Music Discovery

As a music enthusiast, I want to search for songs and get comprehensive metadata from Spotify's catalog, so that I can discover new music with detailed audio features, popularity metrics, and accurate release information.

**Detailed Workflow**: Users perform searches through the existing `/api/v1/songs/search` endpoint which first queries the local database for fast results, then optionally enriches results with fresh Spotify data including audio features, popularity scores, and preview URLs. The system maintains search performance while providing access to Spotify's vast catalog.

### Real-time Music Data

As an API consumer, I want access to up-to-date music information including popularity trends and audio characteristics, so that I can build applications with current and comprehensive music data.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system automatically syncs popular tracks and user-requested songs with Spotify's API, updating metadata, audio features, and popularity metrics. Background jobs ensure the local database stays current while API responses include both cached and real-time data when needed.

### Spotify Account Integration

As a Spotify user, I want to connect my Spotify account to access my playlists and listening history, so that I can get personalized recommendations based on my actual music preferences.

**Detailed Workflow**: Users authenticate with Spotify OAuth through a new endpoint, allowing the system to access their playlists, recently played tracks, and saved music. This data enriches the recommendation engine and enables personalized search results and suggestions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Spotify API Client Integration** - Implement secure Spotify Web API client with proper authentication and rate limiting
2. **Hybrid Search Enhancement** - Extend existing search to optionally fetch and cache Spotify metadata for improved results
3. **Database Schema Extension** - Add Spotify-specific fields and sync tracking to existing song model
4. **OAuth User Authentication** - Enable users to connect their Spotify accounts for personalized features
5. **Background Sync Service** - Implement scheduled jobs to keep popular tracks and user data synchronized with Spotify

## Out of Scope

- Complete replacement of local search functionality
- Spotify playback control or music streaming
- Spotify playlist creation/modification (read-only access initially)
- Real-time collaborative playlists
- Advanced analytics beyond basic usage tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can search for music and receive enriched results with Spotify audio features, popularity, and preview URLs
2. API response times remain under 300ms for cached results with optional fresh data fetching
3. Spotify-authenticated users can access personalized search results based on their listening history and saved tracks
