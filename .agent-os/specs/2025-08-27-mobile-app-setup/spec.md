# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Mobile App Setup and Configuration
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Initialize and configure a React Native mobile application using Expo that will serve as the client interface for the musicez AI-powered music recommendation API. This foundational setup will establish the development environment, core navigation, authentication infrastructure, and API integration patterns needed for subsequent feature development.

## User Stories

### Mobile Developer Setup

As a mobile developer, I want to have a properly configured React Native Expo project with TypeScript, so that I can build features efficiently with type safety and modern development tools.

The developer should be able to clone the project, run `npm install`, and immediately start the development server with `expo start`. The project should include navigation structure, state management, API client configuration, and all necessary development tools configured and ready to use.

### App User Foundation

As an app user, I want to see a functional mobile application with basic navigation and authentication screens, so that I can understand the app structure and prepare for upcoming features like music search and recommendations.

The user should see a well-structured app with placeholder screens for main features (Search, Recommendations, Profile) and functional authentication flow that connects to the existing backend API.

## Spec Scope

1. **Expo React Native Project Initialization** - Create new Expo project with TypeScript configuration and essential dependencies
2. **Navigation Setup with React Navigation v6** - Configure tab-based navigation with main screens and authentication flow
3. **State Management with Zustand** - Implement lightweight state management for auth, API states, and user preferences
4. **HTTP Client Configuration** - Set up Axios with JWT token interceptors, environment-specific base URLs, and error handling
5. **Authentication Infrastructure** - Create login/register screens with JWT token storage using Expo SecureStore
6. **Development Environment Configuration** - Set up debugging tools, environment variables, and build configurations for iOS/Android

## Out of Scope

- Detailed UI/UX design and styling (beyond basic functional layouts)
- Specific feature implementations (song search, recommendations, Spotify integration)
- Advanced state management patterns (complex caching, offline support)
- Push notifications or analytics integration
- App store deployment configurations

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional React Native Expo application that can be run on iOS/Android simulators and physical devices with `expo start`
2. Working authentication flow with login/register screens that successfully authenticate against the existing musicez API at `/api/v1/auth`
3. Tab-based navigation structure with placeholder screens for Search, Recommendations, and Profile features ready for future development
