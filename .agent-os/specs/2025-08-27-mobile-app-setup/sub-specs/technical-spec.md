# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-mobile-app-setup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Project Setup and Configuration
- Initialize Expo SDK 50+ React Native project with TypeScript template
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and React Native specific settings
- Set up package.json scripts for development, build, and testing
- Configure Metro bundler for React Native and Expo compatibility
- Create app.json/app.config.js with iOS/Android platform configurations

### Navigation Architecture
- Install and configure React Navigation v6 with native stack and bottom tabs
- Create authentication flow with conditional navigation (logged in/out states)
- Implement main tab navigation: Search, Recommendations, Profile tabs
- Set up navigation types and screen param definitions with TypeScript
- Configure deep linking scheme for future Spotify OAuth integration

### State Management Implementation
- Install and configure Zustand for lightweight state management
- Create authentication store (user data, tokens, login state)
- Create API store for loading states and error handling
- Create app store for user preferences and settings
- Implement persistence for auth state using AsyncStorage integration

### HTTP Client Configuration
- Install and configure Axios with custom instance for API calls
- Set up base URL configuration for development/staging/production environments
- Implement request interceptors for automatic JWT token attachment
- Implement response interceptors for token refresh and error handling
- Create API service layer with TypeScript interfaces matching backend endpoints
- Configure timeout settings and retry logic for network reliability

### Authentication System
- Create login and register screens with form validation using react-hook-form
- Implement JWT token storage using Expo SecureStore for security
- Set up automatic token refresh flow using refresh tokens
- Create authentication context and hooks for app-wide auth state
- Implement logout functionality with token cleanup

### Development Environment
- Configure environment variables using Expo Constants for different environments
- Set up React Native Debugger integration and debugging configurations
- Install and configure Jest for unit testing with React Native Testing Library
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting
- Configure VS Code settings and extensions for optimal React Native development
- Create development scripts for simulator launching and debugging

### Platform Configurations
- Configure iOS build settings in app.json (bundle identifier, icons, splash screen)
- Configure Android build settings in app.json (package name, icons, splash screen)
- Set up basic app icons and splash screens for both platforms
- Configure status bar and navigation bar styling for both platforms

## External Dependencies

- **@react-navigation/native** - Core navigation library for React Native
- **@react-navigation/native-stack** - Native stack navigator for screen transitions
- **@react-navigation/bottom-tabs** - Bottom tab navigator for main app navigation
- **react-native-screens** - Optimize navigation performance
- **react-native-safe-area-context** - Handle device safe areas properly
- **zustand** - Lightweight state management solution
- **axios** - HTTP client for API communication
- **react-hook-form** - Form validation and management
- **@expo/vector-icons** - Icon library for React Native
- **expo-secure-store** - Secure storage for JWT tokens
- **expo-constants** - Environment variable access
- **@types/react** - TypeScript types for React
- **@types/react-native** - TypeScript types for React Native

**Justification:** These dependencies provide the essential functionality for navigation, state management, HTTP communication, form handling, and secure storage required by the musicez mobile application. All dependencies are well-maintained, widely adopted in the React Native ecosystem, and align with the existing backend API architecture.
