All foundational setup tasks have been completed successfully:

### What Was Built:
- **Expo React Native Project**: TypeScript template with proper configuration
- **Navigation System**: React Navigation v6 with auth/main flow switching
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Project Structure**: Organized folders for scalable development
- **Placeholder Screens**: Ready for feature implementation

### Next Steps:
Future feature development (search, recommendations, authentication API integration, etc.) will be implemented in separate spec folders following the Agent OS workflow.

The mobile app foundation is ready for feature development! ðŸš€
