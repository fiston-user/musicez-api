# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Spotify Search Integration
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Complete the integration between the existing Spotify search functionality and the enhanced search endpoint to enable real-time searching across both the local database and Spotify's catalog. This feature will provide users with comprehensive search results by querying both sources in parallel and intelligently merging the results.

## User Stories

### Music Discovery Through Combined Search

As a music enthusiast with a Spotify account, I want to search for songs and get results from both the local database and Spotify's vast catalog, so that I can discover music that might not be in the local database yet.

When I search for "Beatles Yesterday", the system searches both the local database (which may have curated songs with rich metadata) and Spotify (which has the complete Beatles catalog). The results are merged intelligently, with local results prioritized due to their similarity scores, but Spotify-exclusive tracks are also included. If I find a Spotify track I like that's not in the local database, I can use it for recommendations, and the system can optionally import it for future use.

### Seamless Fallback for Limited Local Results  

As an API user, I want the search to automatically query Spotify when local results are limited, so that I always get comprehensive search results even for obscure or new releases.

When searching for a newly released song that hasn't been added to the local database yet, instead of getting no results, the system automatically queries Spotify and returns those results. This ensures users always get relevant results, improving the overall search experience and discovery capabilities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Wire EnhancedSongSearchService to Controller** - Connect the existing EnhancedSongSearchService class to the search controller to enable Spotify search functionality
2. **Parallel Search Execution** - Implement parallel querying of local database and Spotify API when enrich parameter is true
3. **Intelligent Result Merging** - Deduplicate and merge results from both sources, prioritizing local results while including Spotify-exclusive tracks
4. **Spotify Track Import** - Add endpoint to import Spotify tracks into the local database when users select Spotify-only results
5. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure combined search maintains sub-200ms response time target through proper caching and concurrent execution

## Out of Scope

- Automatic bulk import of all Spotify search results
- Spotify playlist import functionality  
- Audio feature extraction for Spotify tracks (requires separate Essentia.js integration)
- Modification of existing basic search endpoint
- Changes to authentication or rate limiting

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced search endpoint (/search/enhanced) returns combined results from both local database and Spotify when enrich=true parameter is provided
2. Search results clearly indicate source (local, spotify, or merged) and include Spotify metadata like preview URLs
3. New endpoint (POST /songs/import-spotify) successfully imports individual Spotify tracks to the local database with proper metadata
